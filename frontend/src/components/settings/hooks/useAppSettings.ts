/*
 * The slice of /api/settings a screen needs to read but never writes.
 *
 * `SettingsView` fetches the whole settings payload into ~50 useState pairs
 * because the General and Models tabs *edit* it. The three screens split out of
 * it only ever read three fields — the default model an agent falls back to,
 * and the n8n URL and key that decide whether the tool builder can offer a
 * workflow picker — so they get the payload read-only rather than 50 setters
 * drilled through them.
 *
 * Deliberately not in Redux. This is request state, not shared app state: the
 * settings screens own the writes, and a cache here would go stale the moment
 * one of them saved.
