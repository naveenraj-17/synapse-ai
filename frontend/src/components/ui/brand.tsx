/**
 * The SynapseOrch mark, wordmark and loader.
 *
 * Three nested layers around a solid core. The layers are the hidden layers;
 * the gaps in them are the synapses; a signal crosses between two layers only
 * through a gap that belongs to both. That last rule is what fixes every angle
 * in the geometry — it is not a styling choice, and
 * `scripts/gen-brand.mjs --audit` fails if an edit breaks it.
 *
 * The geometry is generated, not written here: see `brand.paths.ts` and the
 * script that emits it. The loader is derived from the *same* radii and gap
 * angles as the static mark, so the logo and the animation cannot drift apart.
 *
 * DEPENDS ON `brand-motion.css`, imported by `globals.css` in both apps. That
 * is a cross-repo contract, the same shape as the one `--ui-radius` already
 * has: the class names below are inert without it.

 * one period so a new signal enters every `period / signals` seconds.
 *
 * Use it where work is genuinely in flight — a turn streaming, a tool call, a
 * sign-in resolving. Route-level skeletons stay skeletons: swapping one for a
 * centred spinner makes a screen feel slower, not faster.
 *
 * Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the travelling signals are replaced by parked
 * ones (see `brand-motion.css`), so the mark still reads as busy while nothing
