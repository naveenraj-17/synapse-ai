/**
 * Buttons, and the two things that are buttons in every way except the element.
 *
 * `Button` is the `<button>`; `LinkButton` is a navigation that looks like one;
 * `IconButton` is the square, label-less form used in table rows and panel
 * headers. All three share `buttonStyles` so a row of them lines up on the
 * pixel — before this, the icon button existed in four hand-written copies
 * (the row menu trigger, the dialog close, the run controls, the copy button)
 * at three different sizes.
 *
 * No `"use client"`: none of this holds state, so it renders on the server when
 * a server component asks for it and folds into the client bundle when a client
 * component does.

 * means a screen reader user hears the same word six times per row.
 *
 * **And it is shown on hover, not only announced.** `aria-label` served the
 * screen-reader case and left everyone else guessing at a row of three
 * unlabelled glyphs. `title` carries the same string, so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * Deliberately the native tooltip and not `Hint`, which was tried and reverted:
 * `Hint` has to wrap its child in a focusable `inline-flex` span — that is what
 * lets it explain a *disabled* control, whose `pointer-events: none` would
 * otherwise swallow the hover. Around an enabled icon button that wrapper buys
 * nothing and costs a layout box and a second tab stop on every one of them,
 * which is visible as soon as several sit in a rail. A caller that needs the
 * disabled case can still wrap in `Hint` itself.
