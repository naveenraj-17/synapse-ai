/**
 * Tooltip.
 *
 * Mostly here to explain *disabled* controls, which is the case a `title`
 * attribute handles worst: a disabled button fires no pointer events, so the
 * native tooltip never appears on the one control whose reason you most need.
 * `Hint` wraps the child in a focusable span so the explanation is reachable by
 * hover, by keyboard, and by touch.
 *
 * `Provider` is mounted once in the org layout rather than per tooltip — nested
 * providers each keep their own open-delay timer, so a page with several would
 * lose the "second tooltip opens instantly" behaviour that makes a row of icon
 * buttons feel responsive rather than sticky.
