/**
 * The design system.
 *
 * One barrel so every screen imports from `@/components/ui` regardless of how
 * the files are arranged underneath — the split from one `ui.tsx` into several
 * modules, and later the split of `primitives.tsx` into the seven files below,
 * both happened without a call site changing.
 *
 * The dividing line: the presentational files are markup and Tailwind with no
 * interaction model worth outsourcing, and carry no `"use client"` so they
 * render on the server when a server component asks. Everything under the
 * second group wraps a Radix primitive, because focus traps, portalling,
 * type-ahead, `aria-activedescendant` and scroll locking are the parts that are
 * quietly hard to write and very obvious when they are wrong.
