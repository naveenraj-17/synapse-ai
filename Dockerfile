# Node 20 + npm for the npx-based MCP servers, from Debian (base is Debian 13
# trixie, whose nodejs is already v20). Do NOT go back to
# `curl -fsSL …nodesource… | bash -`: the pipe discards curl's exit code, so an
# intermittent 403 fell through to Debian's `nodejs` — which ships only
# /usr/bin/node, no npm/npx. This image pre-installs no MCP servers and resolves
# every one through `npx` at runtime, so v1.8.4 shipped with all of them broken.
# npm is a separate package here; the assertion below keeps it from vanishing again.
