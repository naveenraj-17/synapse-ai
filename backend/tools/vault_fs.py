"""
The vault, as an MCP server, addressed by key rather than by path.

## Why this exists

The worker fleet used to reach vault files through the Node
`@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`, rooted at `core/vault.py::_vault_root()`.
Two things were wrong with that and only the first was obvious.

It spawned `npx`, and no scale-mode image ships Node — so it failed on every
tenant's module build, forever, taking about seven seconds each time to raise
`FileNotFoundError` for a binary that does not exist.

The deeper problem is that it took a **directory**. On a fleet the vault
directory is a working copy that `core/vault_backend.py` materialises from the
blob store on demand, so the server read whatever had been hydrated — reporting
an empty vault on any replica that had not served that tenant before. Where the
blob store is an object store there is no directory to root at at all.

This server goes through `core.storage.get_blob_store()` instead. It reads the
vault itself rather than a copy of it, one implementation serves a local install
and an object store alike, and there is no Node.

## Tenancy

**Every key is scoped by `core/storage/base.py::tenant_key`, inside the store.**
Nothing here adds the tenant, which is deliberate: that module says the prefixing
lives in the store "because a call site that forgets is a cross-tenant read and
there are dozens of them". This file is one more call site and gets no exception.

The tenant itself arrives on `SYNAPSE_TENANT_ID` and is adopted by
`core/tool_server.py::bootstrap`, which is why every handler awaits `ready()`
before touching the store.

## Read-only, for now

`list_files`, `read_file`, `search_files`, `read_json`. No write and no delete.
Tool output still reaches the vault through `core/vault.py::maybe_vault`, so
agents can still produce files; letting one write arbitrary keys raises quota,
abuse and metering questions that belong with the document-RAG work rather than
here.

`prefix` is a first-class argument on the listing and search tools rather than a
hardcoded vault root, because the next thing to live in this store is per-agent
RAG material under its own prefix, and a server that can only see one folder
would have to be rewritten to serve it.

#: How many files `search_files` will open before it stops.
#:
#: Each one is a `get` against the blob store — a network round trip on S3 — so
#: this bounds a tool call's wall-clock time, not just its output size. Read
#: with `_SEARCH_CONCURRENCY` in mind: serially, 200 S3 round trips would run

#: what it had found.
_SEARCH_FILE_LIMIT = 200

#: How many of those reads are in flight at once.
#:
#: `BlobStore.get` is synchronous, so each runs on a thread. Sixteen is chosen
#: against the bound above rather than for throughput: it keeps a full-width
#: search inside a few seconds while staying far below anything that would look
#: like a burst to S3 from a worker already running several jobs.
_SEARCH_CONCURRENCY = 16

#: Vault files are tool output and can be very large; `read_file` takes a line
#: range for exactly that reason.
