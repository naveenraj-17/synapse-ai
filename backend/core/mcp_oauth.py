"""Refreshing a remote MCP server's OAuth access token.

An access token is short-lived by design — an hour is typical — and until this
existed nothing renewed one. A server authorised in the morning stopped working
by lunchtime, and the failure was invisible in the worst way: the server answers
`401`, the MCP client's task group cancels its host, and what surfaced was a
cancelled job rather than "your Vercel token expired".

`routes/mcp.py` in the cloud has documented a `reauth_needed` status since it was
written. Nothing could ever set it, because nothing could try a refresh.

## Why it lives in the engine

Both products need it. The self-hosted server holds the same tokens in its own
store, and a refresh implemented in the cloud router only would leave every
self-hosted install with the same silent expiry.

## What it needs, and why that was the hard part

A refresh takes a refresh token, the token endpoint and the client credentials.
The cloud held all three **only in the single-use Redis state** that carries an
authorization through its callback, which expires ten minutes after the person
clicks Approve — so a refresh was not merely unimplemented, it was impossible.
They are persisted onto the server's definition now, the secret ones as
`synsec://` references that resolve on the way to the worker.

## Persisting the new token

The engine cannot write cloud's `org_secrets` and must not know its naming, so
the caller registers a persister. Nothing registered is a supported state: the
refresh still works for the life of the process, and is simply asked for again
next time. That keeps this module useful in a test and in a CLI.
