"""
A real, writable, tenant-scoped directory for append-shaped work.

`BlobStore` deliberately has no `append`: S3 has no such operation, so
implementing one would mean either read-modify-write over the network — worse
than the local cost it was meant to save — or per-writer multipart state, which
puts a stateful session inside a protocol whose whole value is that it is six
stateless methods.

Logs are the append-shaped case. They are written a line at a time over the
life of a run and read as a whole afterwards. So they are appended to a real
file here and published with a single `put()` when the run ends.

Contents are safe to lose. Anything durable has been published; a scratch
directory that a container throws away costs at most the tail of a run that was
still in flight.
