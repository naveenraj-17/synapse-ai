"""
Serving `load_settings()` from the store without making it async.

`load_settings()` is called from roughly sixteen synchronous places on the
execution path — every vaulted tool result, the stdio MCP gate, notifications,
the scale config, and nine sites across tools/steps/react_engine. Making it
async would push `await` through all of them and out into their callers for no
gain, since none of those sites can usefully do anything else while waiting.

So the asynchronous read happens at a boundary, and the synchronous provider
reads what the boundary left behind:

    ContextVar  →  per-tenant process cache  →  default_settings()

The worker binds at job entry. The API server binds per request and refreshes
on a TTL, because in a multi-replica deployment another process may have
written the row. Both use this module; the worker's own copy of this logic is
gone.

Failing closed
--------------
A read with nothing bound returns the shipped defaults rather than whatever the
last execution happened to leave in the cache. Returning another tenant's
settings would leak their provider keys.

Note that "the defaults" is not automatically the safe answer: `allow_stdio_mcp`
defaults to True, so a miss re-opens the gate that GHSA-3j67-x3j8-r32x closed.
`is_loaded()` exists so a security check can tell "nothing is bound" apart from
"the tenant allows it" — see `core.mcp_client.stdio_mcp_allowed`.
