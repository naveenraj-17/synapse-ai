"""
What a native tool server has to do before it serves its first request.

Native tools are MCP servers running as subprocesses. That makes them ordinary
Python processes that happen to have been spawned by the engine — and it means
two things the engine sets up for itself do not reach them:

1. **A ContextVar does not cross a process boundary.** `tools/bash.py` and
   `tools/sandbox.py` call `core.vault._vault_root()`, which resolves
   `get_blob_store().path_for(...)` → `root / get_tenant()`. Inside a subprocess
   that is always the default tenant, whoever called the tool. Harmless in a
   single-tenant install; a cross-tenant read on a shared fleet.

2. **Nobody installs the settings provider.** Only `core/server.py` and
   `core/scale/worker.py` call `settings_runtime.install_provider()`, so
   `load_settings()` in a tool subprocess returns `default_settings()`. That
   became true when `_load_settings_from_disk` was deleted in Phase 6 and went
   unnoticed: `bash_allowed_dirs` and `vault_threshold` quietly stopped being
   honoured wherever a tool read them for itself.

`bootstrap()` fixes both, and every tool server in `TENANT_SCOPED_TOOLS` calls it
as the first thing in `main()`.

`SYNAPSE_TENANT_ID`, `SYNAPSE_DOCUMENT_RESOLVER` and `SYNAPSE_SESSION_BINDER`
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module is the only one permitted to read them, in the same way
`core/store/importer.py` is the only module permitted to name
`SYNAPSE_DATA_DIR`. `tests/unit/test_tool_server.py` asserts the allowlist, so a
third one is a conversation rather than a silent widening.

`SYNAPSE_DOCUMENT_RESOLVER` names an import path — `package.module:function` —
installed as `core/store/collections.py`'s document resolver. It exists because
a tool subprocess reads the store *itself*: an embedder that keeps credentials
outside `collections` and stores references cannot swap them in the parent, so
the subprocess has to be told how. Unset in the shipped product, where documents
hold their own values and there is nothing to resolve.

It names code to import, so whatever can set it can already run code in this
process — it widens nothing that spawning the subprocess did not already.

It is worth being precise about what it does and does not do. It fixes the
tenant of a process that already exists to serve exactly one tenant — the parent
spawns a separate server per tenant and labels each. It does **not** enable
multi-tenancy: `tenant_scope()` is still shut unless an embedder registers a
resource provider, so there is no path from this variable to a process serving
two tenants, and nothing in the shipped product sets it at all.

`SYNAPSE_SESSION_BINDER` is the same idea for the *connection*: an import path
installed as `core/store/engine.py`'s session binder, run on every session this
process opens. A deployment that gates the same rows a second time — row-level
security compares against a per-transaction setting — cannot otherwise be heard
from inside a subprocess, because the store is opened here rather than passed
in. Also unset in the shipped product.

    A tool subprocess opens the store **itself**, so a deployment that enforces
    tenancy on the connection — Postgres row-level security, in the case that
    prompted this — has no way to make itself heard: the parent's binding does
    not cross `fork+exec`, and `collections.load()` opens its own session. The
    symptom is not an error. It is a table that reads as empty, which looks
    exactly like a workspace that has configured nothing.

    is spawned by a server or a worker that already owns the schema, so any DDL
    from here is at best redundant and at worst wrong: an embedder whose tables
    carry columns and policies the engine does not know about (a tenant column,
    a foreign key, a row-level security policy) would get a second, unpoliced
    set created underneath it. That is the same hazard the scale worker's
    `set_store()` call exists to prevent, one process further out.

    In the cloud fleet this surfaced as `permission denied for schema public`:
    the tool subprocess connects as an application role that deliberately cannot
    CREATE, so `collections.load()` raised before any tool ran and every
    database-backed tool was dead. The grant was doing its job; this is the
    thing it was standing in for.

    `set_store()` installs the factory directly, which is what makes `init_db()`
    unreachable — see `core/store/engine.py::get_store`.

#

# handler wait for it. `list_tools` deliberately does not wait — advertising a
