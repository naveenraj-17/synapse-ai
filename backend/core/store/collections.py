"""
The small document collections, tenant-scoped.

Repos, database configs, API keys, personal details and messaging channels were
five JSON files behind five `JsonStore` singletons, each bound to a path at
import time. None of them is queried by anything but its own key, so they share
one table rather than getting five schemas — see `CollectionDB`.

The API is deliberately list-shaped, because that is what every caller wants
and what the JSON files provided: `load(name)` returns the items in insertion
order, `save(name, items)` replaces them. The one difference from the files is
that a replace is a diff rather than a truncate-and-rewrite, so two writers do
not silently drop each other's rows for collections that grow.

Singletons — personal details is one document, not a list — use `load_one` /
`save_one`, which store it under an empty key.

Stored references
-----------------
An embedder may keep a credential outside this table and store a *reference* to
it in the document — the value in the JSONB is an address, not a secret. Those
documents are read by code that expects the real value (`tools/sql_agent.py`
hands `connection_string` straight to `create_engine`), so the swap has to
happen on the way out of the store rather than at every call site.

`set_document_resolver()` is that seam. Nothing is registered by default, so the
shipped product reads exactly what it wrote. It is the sixth registration
alongside `set_store`, `set_resource_provider`, `set_job_tenant_resolver`,
`set_api_key_provider`, `set_settings_provider` and `set_blob_store` — same
shape, same reason: the engine describes the hole and the embedder fills it.
