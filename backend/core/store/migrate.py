"""
Additive schema migrations, run after ``create_all``.

``Base.metadata.create_all`` creates tables that do not exist and then stops.
It never inspects an existing table, so a column added to a model after someone
has already booted the build is invisible to them for good: no error, no
migration, just a query selecting a column the database does not have.

There is no Alembic in this repo, and adding one for a handful of columns would
put a migrations directory, a version table and an offline/online split in the
way of a single-file SQLite install. Instead this module runs idempotent
``ADD COLUMN`` statements at startup.

The scope is deliberately narrow. ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`` is the one
form SQLite and Postgres spell identically and both apply cheaply. Any change
that renames, drops, retypes or backfills needs a real migration tool — if this
file ever wants one of those, that is the signal to bring in Alembic rather
than to widen this.

The one exception is ``_REBUILDS``, below: a table whose *primary key* has
changed cannot be reached by ADD COLUMN at all, and neither dialect can repoint
one in place. It is implemented as the copy-and-rename every such migration
reduces to, and it is guarded so tightly that it runs once and then never
matches again. Two entries here would be the signal for Alembic.
