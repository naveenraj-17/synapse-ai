"""
The engine's database connection: one URL, two dialects, one code path.

A plain install gets SQLite in the install directory and needs nothing running.
A scale deployment or an embedder points ``SYNAPSE_DB_URL`` at Postgres. There
is no ``if sqlite:`` branch anywhere above this module — the difference is a
connection string.

Why SQLite is the default rather than "no database"
---------------------------------------------------
The engine previously kept its state in JSON files under a ``DATA_DIR``. That
made the product a thing you install on one machine, and it made every step
towards running more than one of anything a workaround. SQLite keeps the
zero-setup install property that mattered about the JSON files while giving up
none of the structure.
