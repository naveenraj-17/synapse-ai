"""One-time import of a pre-store install's `backend/logs/` into the store.

## Why this is separate from `importer.py`

`importer.py` migrates `backend/data/` — orchestrations, agents, tools, MCP
servers, settings, usage. **Run logs were never in that folder**, so they were
never in its scope, and D29 moved where they are *read* from without moving
what already existed. The result is silent and specific:

* `OrchestrationLogger.list_logs()` reads the blob store and a scratch dir.
* `backend/logs/orchestration_logs/*.log` is read by nothing.
* The "Runs & Logs" screen still exists, its endpoints still answer, and every
  one of them returns `[]`.

On the install this was found on that is 3,685 orchestration logs, 1,293 agent
logs and 394 run-state files — intact on disk, invisible in the product, with
nothing anywhere saying where they went.

## Why it cannot reuse `importer.py`'s triggers

Both of its guards are wrong here, and in opposite directions:

* It keys off `backend/data/` existing. An install that has already upgraded has
  `data.migrated/`, so a log import hung off the same trigger would never run
  for exactly the people who need it.
* It refuses unless `store_is_empty()`. By definition the store is *not* empty
  by the time anyone notices their logs are missing.

So this has its own trigger — `backend/logs/` exists and holds something — and
its own idempotence: the rename to `logs.migrated/` is what stops it running
twice, the same mechanism `importer.py` uses on `data/`.

## What is not imported

`logs/orchestration_events/*.jsonl` are the live event journals a run appends to
while it is streaming, replayed by a browser that reconnects mid-run. They are a
buffer, not history — the run's durable record is its row and its log — and a
finished run's journal is closed. Copying them would restore nothing readable.
