"""
The usage event log and the model rate card.

Two tables with opposite tenancy, in one module because one is read to price
the other.

`usage_logs` is tenant data and append-only: one row per LLM call, written on
the per-turn path. As a JSON file every call loaded the whole list, appended
and wrote it all back, so logging a call cost more the longer the install had
been running — and two concurrent turns could lose one of the two records.

`model_pricing` is **not** tenant data. What a model costs is the same number
for every tenant, so a tenant column would give each org a private copy of one
rate card and mean an operator updating a price reached nobody. See
`ModelPricingDB`.

Why the summaries still aggregate in Python
-------------------------------------------
`get_usage_logs` is a real query here — filtered, ordered and limited by the
database. The two summary functions in `core/usage_tracker.py` are not; they
stream rows from this module and group them in Python, as they always have.
That is deliberate: they collect `models_used` and `agents_used` as *sets*, and
set aggregation is the one part of this that SQLite and Postgres do not spell
the same way (`group_concat` versus `string_agg`). `core/store/models.py` says
not to reach for dialect-specific SQL, and these run on a settings screen
rather than the hot path, so the portable answer is the right one.
