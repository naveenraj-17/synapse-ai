"""
Which server services a tool call.

The router is the engine's dispatch table: a name the model produced, mapped to
the MCP session that answers it. It used to be a plain dict keyed by the **bare**
tool name, and that had one silent failure mode. Two servers advertising the same
tool name — `read_file_by_lines` from both `file_reader` and `code_vault_search`,
say — meant the last one to connect won and the other became unreachable, with
nothing anywhere saying so. External MCP servers were namespaced as
``{server}__{tool}`` (`core/server.py`) but native ones were not, so the rule
depended on which branch of startup a server happened to come through.

Now every key is ``{server}__{tool}``, and a bare name is an **alias** that
resolves to whichever server registered it last. Same behaviour as before at the
point of dispatch, with three differences that matter:

* the shadowed copy is still addressable, under its own namespaced key, so an
  agent that wants `code_vault_search`'s repo-aware reader can ask for it;
* the collision is *recorded* rather than lost — see ``ambiguous()``;
* a tenant's own MCP server can no longer quietly take over a native tool name
  for that tenant's runs, because the native tool keeps its own key.

Why a ``dict`` subclass
-----------------------
Because roughly a dozen tests build a server-module stand-in as
``types.SimpleNamespace(agent_sessions={}, memory_store=None, tool_router={})``,
and `core/orchestration/steps.py` reads it as
``getattr(server_module, "tool_router", {})``. Every consumer uses plain mapping
operations — ``in``, ``[]``, ``.get()``, ``.items()``, ``del`` — so staying a
mapping keeps all of them working without a coordinated edit, and a plain ``{}``
remains a valid (if alias-less) router.
