"""
Where the vault actually lives — a directory, or an object store.

The vault holds large tool outputs, and the awkward part is that it hands
*filesystem paths* to the model and to the Filesystem MCP server: `read_file`,
`search_files`, `grep` and the sandbox's `-v` mount all need a real directory.
That is fine when the vault is a directory. It is not fine when the vault is S3,
which has no paths — `BlobStore.path_for()` returns None for exactly that reason.

So there are two backends and a factory picks one:

    LocalVault   the directory *is* the vault. A plain install, unchanged: every
                 filesystem operation works because there is a real filesystem
                 under it, and nothing is uploaded anywhere.

    S3Vault      the object store is the vault; a directory under the scratch
                 root is a materialised working copy. Writes go to both and the
                 object store is authoritative. Reads hydrate on demand. A pod
                 that dies takes only the working copy with it, which is the
                 whole point — the next pod rebuilds it from the store.

The choice is not a mode flag. It is asked of the blob store: a store that can
give a path gets `LocalVault`, a store that cannot gets `S3Vault`. One question,
one answer, and an embedder that registers some third kind of storage gets the
right behaviour without this module knowing about it.

What this replaces
------------------
`maybe_vault` used to answer "is S3 configured?" through `core.s3_storage.get_s3()`
while everything else asked `get_blob_store()` — two sources of truth for one
fact. And the upload was fire-and-forget under `except Exception: pass`, so in a
deployment where the object store *is* the durable copy, a failed upload handed
the model a path to a file that would not survive the pod. Silently.

What is honestly still partial
------------------------------
Hydration is per file on demand, plus `hydrate()` for a directory before an
operation that needs to see the whole of one. A directory-shaped call made by a
*subprocess* we do not control — the Filesystem MCP server's own `search_files`
— sees whatever has been materialised on this pod. `build_for_tenant` hydrates
when a tenant becomes active on a worker, which covers the case that matters;
a cross-run search on a cold pod can still miss files until they are touched.
