"""Single-task runner for orchestration engine streams.

The engine holds anyio cancel scopes across `yield`s (the per-step timeout at
`engine._execute_loop`). anyio binds a cancel scope to the task that entered
it, so the engine's generator must be advanced -- and closed -- from ONE task,
whatever the HTTP layer does with the events. A consumer that pulls each event
in a fresh task raises "Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different task"
(issue #356).

Every orchestration entry point goes through here, so the launch path can no
longer change how the engine is driven. That makes the pump the single choke
point for run observability: every event is appended to the run's journal
(`journal.FileRunJournal`) and fanned out to live tails (`journal.broker`)
before it reaches the SSE queue. A journal/broker/observer failure must never
kill a run -- all three are best-effort.
