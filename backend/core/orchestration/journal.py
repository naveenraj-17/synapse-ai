"""Append-only per-run event journal + in-process broker for live tailing.

Every event the engine emits for a run is journaled as one JSONL line in
`backend/logs/orchestration_events/{run_id}.jsonl`:

    {"id": <monotonic seq>, "ts": <epoch seconds>, "event": {...}}

The id is embedded in the line (not derived from the byte offset) so a torn
final line — a crash mid-write — costs at most that one event: `read()` skips
unparseable lines, and the next pump recovers the sequence from the last valid
line and continues it. Run → resume → human-input pumps for the same run share
one journal instance (see `get_journal`), so ids stay monotonic across the
whole lifetime of a run.

This is the standalone-mode counterpart of the Redis Stream published by scale
workers (`core.scale.pubsub.RunEventPublisher`): the read endpoints in
`routes/orchestrations.py` serve whichever of the two exists for a run.

Builder flows (`builder_*` run ids) are intentionally NOT journaled: they are
ephemeral UI conversations driven by `routes/builder.py`, which bypasses the
runner pump on purpose.

Writes are synchronous: a flushed append of a bounded line is microseconds,
which is noise next to the LLM/tool latency between events, and it keeps this
module free of extra dependencies. The pump wraps every append in try/except —
a journal failure must never kill a run.
