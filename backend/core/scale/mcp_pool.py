"""
One set of live MCP sessions per tenant, bounded, with idle eviction.

The worker used to call ``WorkerServerModule.build()`` once in ``on_startup`` and
hand the result to every job. One set of MCP sessions, opened from whatever
configuration existed at boot, served every tenant the process ran — which was
correct while a process belonged to one org, and is the last shared-process
assumption in the engine.

The unit is the module, not the session, because ``tool_router`` and
``agent_sessions`` are already per-instance. What was missing is a keyed cache
with a bound and a teardown.

Why bounded
-----------
A fleet sized for a thousand mostly-idle orgs must not hold a thousand live
session sets. Entries are evicted least-recently-used past ``POOL_SIZE``, and on
idle past ``IDLE_TTL`` regardless of size. What a tenant actually costs here is
small — stdio MCP is force-disabled in scale mode, so a tenant's own servers are
remote SSE connections, and the only subprocess is the Filesystem server rooted
at its vault.

**An entry in use is never evicted.** ``max_jobs`` defaults to 10, so several
jobs hold modules concurrently; closing one mid-call would kill the MCP sessions
under a running step.

Why each entry owns a task
--------------------------
anyio requires a cancel scope to be exited by the task that entered it. The
sessions are opened inside an ``AsyncExitStack``, so whichever task ran the build
must be the one to close it. Eviction is triggered by whoever happens to acquire
next — a different task — so an entry keeps a supervisor task that builds,
signals ready, waits, and closes in its own context.

`core/server.py`'s ``_filesystem_mcp_manager`` is the same pattern and carries
the scar that produced it: closing an MCP stack from an HTTP handler propagated a
CancelledError into the lifespan and tore down *every* session in the process.
