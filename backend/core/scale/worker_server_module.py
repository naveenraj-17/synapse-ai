"""
Minimal stub of core.server's server_module interface for use inside worker processes.
Workers don't have a running FastAPI app or interactive MCP session setup,
so this builds a lightweight equivalent that satisfies OrchestrationEngine.

Two halves, because only one of them depends on whose job is running
---------------------------------------------------------------------
``build_shared()`` connects the native tool servers, which are the same for
everybody: `time`, `pdf_parser`, `web_scraper` and the rest advertise the same
tools whoever calls them. It runs once, at worker startup.

``build_for_tenant()`` connects what is *not* the same for everybody — the
Filesystem MCP server, which is rooted at the calling tenant's vault, and that
tenant's own MCP servers. It runs per tenant, behind the bounded pool in
`core/scale/mcp_pool.py`, and the module it returns presents the shared sessions
and its own as one set so nothing downstream has to know about the split.

This used to be a single ``build()`` called once at startup, whose result was
stored on the ARQ context and handed to every job. That meant one set of live
MCP sessions, opened from whatever configuration existed at boot, serving every
tenant — and a Filesystem server rooted at whichever vault `get_tenant()`
resolved to at startup, which is the default tenant's.

    ## Why a task per server

    Every MCP client context manager is backed by an `anyio` task group, and a
    task group that loses a child **cancels its host task on the way out**. When
    all the servers shared one `AsyncExitStack` entered in the module builder's
    task, that host was the builder — so one server answering `401` cancelled the
    task building the whole tenant's module.

    That cost three separate failures before it was understood. `except
    Exception` never caught it (`CancelledError` is a `BaseException`), so ARQ
    recorded the job cancelled and burned its retries. Absorbing the
    cancellation instead was worse: the build finished, the cancellation
    resurfaced at the owner task's next await, and `mcp_pool` was left holding an
    entry with `ready` set, no error and **no module** — every later chat turn
    for that org died instantly on `'NoneType' object has no attribute
    'agent_sessions'`.

    With a task per server the cancellation lands on that server's own task and
    goes no further. The builder is never cancelled, so the pool cannot be
    poisoned, and a failing server can no longer take the servers listed after it
    — which it did, making the outcome depend on the order
    `resolve_mcp_servers()` happened to return.

    ## Why the task also does the closing

    anyio requires a cancel scope to be exited by the task that entered it. The
    stack is opened, used and closed inside `_own_server`, so that holds by
    construction rather than by a comment asking callers to be careful.
    `core/scale/mcp_pool.py::_own` is the same shape one level up, and
    `core/server.py::_filesystem_mcp_manager` carries the scar that produced it.

    It was, and that is a bug with an unusually bad shape. Two transports are in
    common use — streamable HTTP (MCP 2025-03-26+) and the legacy SSE one — and
    `core/mcp_client.py::_open_http_session` has negotiated between them since
    remote servers were added. This path did not: it dialled SSE unconditionally.

    Against a streamable-HTTP endpoint that is not a clean failure. The server
    accepts the GET and simply never sends the `endpoint` event SSE is waiting
    for, so `sse_client` **hangs** — and a hang is not an exception, so the
    `try/except` around the call site catches nothing. One such server wedges
    `WorkerServerModule.build_for_tenant`, which wedges `mcp_pool._own`, which
    leaves every `acquire()` for that tenant waiting on `entry.ready` forever.

    Observed on `https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp`, a `/mcp` endpoint seeded by the
    cloud's app directory: unbounded via SSE, and 2.6 seconds and three tools
    via streamable HTTP. The job holding it sat in `arq:in-progress` for forty
    minutes with nothing published and no `chat_sessions` row written, because
    the pool is acquired before either.

    ## Why there is a timeout as well

    The transport fix removes the case we found; the timeout removes the class.
    A remote server is a third party, and "accepts the connection, then goes
    quiet" is a thing third parties do — through a proxy, mid-deploy, or because
    someone pointed a URL at something that is not an MCP server at all. Nothing
    else in this loop is bounded: `ClientSession`'s `read_timeout_seconds`
    covers requests *after* a session exists, not the handshake that creates one.

    A server that exceeds it is skipped like any other failing server, which is
    what the `except` around the caller already does with everything else.
