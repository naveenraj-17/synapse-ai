"""
The CLI runs at all — driven through `main()`, as a user runs it.

`synapse api-keys generate|list|revoke` was broken for an entire release: when
`core.api_keys` went async, the CLI kept calling it synchronously, so `generate`
returned a coroutine and died on `record['name']`. Running the suite with
`-W error::RuntimeWarning` is what catches un-awaited coroutines everywhere
else, and it could not see this one for a simple reason — **the CLI had no
tests**, so nothing ever executed the line. A warning only fires on code that
runs.

These are deliberately end-to-end through `main()` rather than calls to the
`_*_command` helpers, because roughly half the surface worth protecting is in
argparse: `api-keys revoke <id>` and `api-keys generate <name>` share one
positional, and which one it becomes is decided by the dispatch in `main()`.

Sync tests on purpose. The CLI has no event loop of its own — `synapse/_store.py`
opens one per call with `asyncio.run`, which is safe precisely because the
process is short-lived and single-threaded, and which would raise inside an
already-running loop.
