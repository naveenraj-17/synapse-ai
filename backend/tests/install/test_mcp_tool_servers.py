"""
Boot every native MCP tool server and list its tools (runs in the gate).

This is the test that would have caught the mcp 2.0.0 breakage: a fresh install
resolved an unpinned `mcp`, got the 2.0 rewrite, and *every* tool server died at
import because the lowlevel `Server` no longer exposes `@server.list_tools()`.
The backend swallowed each failure as a warning, started anyway with an empty
`tool_router`, and the UI showed no native tools.

Nothing in the rest of the suite spawns a tool server or opens a `ClientSession`,
so the suite stayed green while the product was completely broken. This closes
that hole by doing the real thing: spawn the server as a subprocess, complete the
stdio handshake, and ask it for its tools — mirroring
`core.server.initialize_agents` exactly.

Because it exercises both halves of the protocol, it catches both classes of SDK
drift at once:

  * server side — the `@app.list_tools()` / `@app.call_tool()` decorators
  * client side — `ClientSession(read_timeout_seconds=...)`, whose type changed
    from `timedelta` to `float` in mcp 2.0 (`unsupported operand type(s) for +:
    'float' and 'datetime.timedelta'`)

Parametrized over the tool registry so a failure names the offending tool.
