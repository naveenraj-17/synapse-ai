"""
`TENANT_SCOPED_TOOLS` is derived from the code, not maintained by hand.

A native tool server is a subprocess. If it resolves the vault, the store or the
tenant's settings *for itself*, it needs to be told which tenant it serves —
because a ContextVar does not survive a fork+exec, and one such server spawned
once and shared reads the default tenant's data whoever calls it. In a
single-tenant install that is invisible. On a shared fleet it is a cross-tenant
read.

The failure mode this guards against is the one that has recurred on this branch
five times: a collection moves, and a reader is left behind, silently. A tool
that starts importing `core.vault` in six months' time will not announce itself.
So the set is checked against the imports rather than trusted.

    Both halves are required and they guard different failures. `serve()` is

    `ready()` is what makes a *handler* wait for it, and it exists because the
    bootstrap no longer completes before the server starts listening: it reads
    Postgres, and doing that ahead of `stdio_server()` put a database on the
    critical path of the MCP handshake, which a cold serverless resume then
    blew straight through.

    A tool with `serve()` and no `ready()` is the subtle one — it works on a
    warm database and races on a cold one, which is the shape of bug that gets
