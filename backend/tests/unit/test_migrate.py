"""
Additive migrations, because `create_all` will not add a column.

`Base.metadata.create_all` creates whole tables and then stops — it never
inspects one that already exists. So a column added to a model after a build
shipped is invisible to everyone who already booted it: no error at startup,
just a query selecting something the database does not have. There is no
Alembic in this repo, so `core/store/migrate.py` closes that gap for the one
statement type both dialects spell identically.
