"""The seam that lets an embedder keep credentials out of `collections`.

`tools/sql_agent.py` hands `connection_string` straight to `create_engine`, so a
document holding an *address* rather than a value has to be swapped on the way
out of the store. Doing it at the call site would mean doing it at every call
site, and missing one produces a driver error about an unknown URL scheme rather
than a clear "that credential is missing".
