"""
A tool subprocess is told which tenant it serves, and that is all it is told.

Native tools are MCP servers running as subprocesses, so a ContextVar does not
reach them: `tools/bash.py` and `tools/sandbox.py` resolved
`core.vault._vault_root()` to the *default* tenant's vault whoever called them,
and `load_settings()` returned the shipped defaults because nothing installs the
settings provider in a subprocess.

`core/tool_server.py` fixes both. It reads `SYNAPSE_TENANT_ID`, and this file
pins the two things that makes true and the one thing it must not:

* it is the only module in the tree allowed to read that variable;
* it fixes the tenant of a process that serves exactly one;
* it does **not** enable multi-tenancy. That still requires an embedder to
  register a resource provider, which is the boundary D30 describes — no
  environment variable can produce a second tenant.
