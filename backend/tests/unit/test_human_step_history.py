"""
A human step is a step, and it appears in `step_history` like one.

It used to be the single kind that never did. `engine.py` breaks out of the step
loop at `human_input_required` *before* the "record step completion" block, and
`resume()` moved past the step without recording it — so an approval was
invisible three times over:

* to anything rendering a run's timeline, which showed the workflow skipping
  straight from the step before the approval to the step after it;
* to billing, which counts `len(step_history)` — every human-in-the-loop run
  under-counted by one step per approval;
* to `_apply_loop_guard`, which counts entries per step id — `exec_count` for a
  human step was permanently 0, so `max_iterations` was unreachable for it. That
  one is a behaviour change rather than a reporting fix; see the class below for
  what it does and does not amount to.

The entry is written at pause with status `paused` and closed on resume, so
history means "steps that started" whether or not the run is still waiting.

    Asserted against the guard directly rather than by running a cycle, because
    two *pre-existing* things would make an end-to-end version prove something
    other than what it claims, and both are worth writing down:

    * the guard's fallback for an over-run step X is X's own `next_step_id`, so
      it cannot break a cycle — X -> Y -> X exceeds, routes to Y, and comes back.
      What actually stops a runaway loop is `max_total_turns` (100);
    * `resume()` calls `_resolve_next` as `next_id, _ = ...`, discarding the
      event, so `loop_limit_reached` and routing decisions are never emitted
      when they happen at a resume boundary.
