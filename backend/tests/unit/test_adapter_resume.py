"""`WorkerEngineAdapter.resume` — the path every fleet resume actually takes.

## Why this file exists

`WorkerEngineAdapter.resume()` is a near-copy of `OrchestrationEngine.resume()`.
The duplication is deliberate — the adapter uses the orchestration the worker
already loaded from the store instead of reloading a definition the process may
not have — but it makes the two a pair that has to change together.

They drifted. `78076d3` taught the classmethod to close the `paused` entry a
human step leaves in `step_history`, and did not teach the adapter. Every test
of that fix drove the classmethod (`test_cross_process_resume.py:68`,
`test_human_step_history.py`), so the suite was green while **every resume on a
shared fleet** left the approval open forever:

* a finished run still showed its human step as awaiting input, with a duration
  that grew against wall-clock for as long as anyone looked at it;
* `_apply_loop_guard` never counted a human step inside a loop, so the guard
  that stops a runaway loop had a hole in it exactly where a human was involved.

This is the `mcp_pool` shape from `test_shared_fleet.py`: a whole code path no
test executed. So these tests drive the adapter, and only the adapter.
