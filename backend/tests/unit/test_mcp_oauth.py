"""Refreshing a remote MCP server's OAuth access token.

An access token lasts about an hour and nothing renewed one, so a server
authorised in the morning stopped working by lunchtime — and reported it as a
cancelled job, because the `401` crashes the MCP client's task group rather than
surfacing as a status code. `reauth_needed` has been in the cloud router's
documented vocabulary since it was written with nothing able to set it.

No network here: `httpx.AsyncClient.post` is replaced. What is worth asserting is
the shape of what gets sent, what gets kept, and what happens when a refresh is
refused — not that httpx works.
