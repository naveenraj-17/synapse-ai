"""
`DATA_DIR` is gone, and it stays gone.

One constant used to name the place settings, orchestrations, agents, tools,
schedules, usage, chat history, the vault, cached responses, run state, logs and
ChromaDB's index all lived — a single directory meaning four different kinds of
thing. That is what made the engine something you installed on a laptop rather
than something a request can be served by: a process could only ever hold one
install's worth of state, so it could only ever serve one tenant.

Removing it is easy to undo by accident. A new module needing somewhere to write
finds `os.getenv("SYNAPSE_DATA_DIR")` in the git history, or a helpful
`DATA_DIR = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "data"`, and the whole shape comes
back one module at a time — exactly how the five stale vault paths in
`test_vault_paths.py` survived a refactor that was supposed to remove them.

So these tests assert the absence, in the same spirit as
`test_no_env_secrets.py`. State now belongs to one of three layers, and which
one it is decides where the code goes:

    core/store/        a document with an identity      → a database row
    core/storage/      tenant content, file-shaped      → a blob key
    core/runtime_dirs  a genuine directory on disk      → a real path

There is exactly one exception, and it is deliberate: `core/store/importer.py`
still knows where a pre-database install kept its JSON, because migrating that
folder away is the whole of its job. It is the only module allowed to say the
name.
