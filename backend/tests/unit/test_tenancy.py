"""
The shipped product is single-tenant, and there is no way to make it otherwise.

The engine is multi-tenant *capable* — that is what lets one worker fleet serve
many tenants concurrently, and it is what an embedder builds on. But tenancy is
a capability of the engine, not a feature of the application: nothing a user can
reach — no setting, no environment variable, no API field, no HTTP route —
produces a second tenant.

These tests are the guard on that boundary. They are the same shape as the
"exactly two SECURITY DEFINER functions" test on the cloud schema: an assertion
about what does *not* exist, which is the only kind that survives someone
helpfully adding a knob back.

This is a product boundary, not a claim about what is possible. The source is
AGPL; a fork may call `enable_multi_tenancy()` and is then distributing a
derivative work under the same licence. What is prevented is the shipped
application offering tenancy as something to switch on.
