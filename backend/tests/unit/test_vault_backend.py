"""
The vault is a directory, or it is an object store, and the code says which.

Open source installs on a laptop: the vault is a folder, every filesystem
operation works because there is a filesystem, and nothing is uploaded anywhere.
Cloud runs on pods that disappear: the object store is the vault and the folder
is a working copy, so a pod dying costs a re-download rather than the data.

Both have to work, and the choice must not be a mode flag anyone can get wrong —
it is asked of the blob store. A store that can give a path gets `LocalVault`; a
store that cannot gets `S3Vault`. `S3BlobStore.path_for()` returns None for
exactly this reason.

What this fixes, concretely: `_vault_root()` used to fall back to a plain
`LocalBlobStore()` whenever the store had no path, so a deployment on object
storage wrote its vault to the pod's own disk — durably, silently, and only
until the pod was replaced. `maybe_vault` did upload a copy to S3, but through
`core.s3_storage.get_s3()` rather than the blob store (a second answer to "is
this cloud"), and under `except Exception: pass`, so a failed upload still told
the model its output was saved.
